# ICU Mortality Prediction (AI Capstone 2025)

Predicting in-hospital mortality using vital signs, lab results, and demographic data collected within the first 6 hours of ICU admission.  
Final project for the **NYCU AI Capstone 2025** course, based on the **MIMIC-IV** dataset.

## üìå Project Overview

Critically ill patients admitted to the ICU have a high risk of in-hospital mortality. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict a patient's survival outcome using early-stage data (first 6 hours after ICU admission).  
Early prediction can help inform clinical decisions and potentially save lives.

---

## üß† Task Description

- **Task:** Binary classification ‚Äî predict whether a patient will die or survive during their hospital stay.
- **Input Data:**  
  - Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.)  
  - Lab test results (creatinine, glucose, platelets, etc.)  
  - Demographics (age, gender, BMI)  
  - Prior diagnoses (if available)
- **Time Window:** First 6 hours of ICU admission

---

## üè• Dataset

- **Source:** [MIMIC-IV](https://mimic.mit.edu/)
- **Subset:** 30% of original population, preprocessed by TAs
- **Cohort Criteria:**
  - First ICU stay only
  - At least 6 hours of data before hospital discharge
  - Includes both survivors and non-survivors

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pipeline

1. **Cohort Selection** ‚úÖ
   - Total patients in MIMIC database: 17316
   - Patients with ICU stays: 17316
   - Filtered to first ICU stay only: 17316
     - Excluded: 0 repeat ICU stays
   - Final cohort with ‚â•6 hours of records: 16922
     - Excluded: 389 patients with <6 hours of records

2. **Feature Extraction** ‚úÖ
   - Demographics:
     - Age, gender
     - BMI (calculated from height and weight)
   - Vital signs (with statistical aggregations):
     - Heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure (SBP, DBP, MAP)
     - Temperature, SpO2
   - Lab results (with statistical aggregations):
     - Complete blood count (WBC, hemoglobin, platelets, etc.)
     - Chemistry (sodium, potassium, creatinine, BUN, etc.)
     - Liver function (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase)
     - Others (lactate, bicarbonate, anion gap)
   - Prior diagnoses information

3. **Data Preprocessing** ‚úÖ
   - Missing data handling:
     - Dropped features with >80% missing values (except BMI)
     - Created missingness indicators for features with 20-80% missing
     - Applied median imputation for clinical features
     - Used KNN imputation for features with <5% missing
   - Outlier handling:
     - Applied clinical range constraints:
       - Heart rate: 30-200 bpm
       - Respiratory rate: 5-60 breaths/min
       - MAP: 40-180 mmHg
       - SBP: 60-220 mmHg
       - SpO2: 60-100%
     - Used Winsorizing (1%-99% percentile capping) for skewed variables
   - Feature transformations:
     - Log transformation for highly skewed features (skew > 2)
     - Polynomial features (squared) for key vital signs
     - Standardization using RobustScaler (resistant to outliers)
   - Feature engineering:
     - Created SIRS criteria count for sepsis risk
     - Added shock index (HR/SBP) for hemodynamic status
     - Added distance-from-normal metrics for vital signs:
       - Temperature deviation from 36.5¬∞C
       - Heart rate deviation from 75 bpm
       - Respiratory rate deviation from 15 breaths/min
       - SBP deviation from 120 mmHg
     - Added temporal trends (delta, percent change)
     - Calculated hypoxemia flag (SpO2 < 92%)
   - Feature selection:
     - Removed redundant features (age vs. anchor_age)
     - Removed log-transformed values when raw features suffice
     - Preserved key clinical variables (vitals, labs, demographics)
     - Applied importance-based feature selection
     - Retained 57 features from original 144 columns

4. **Model Development** üìù
   - Random Forest with cost-sensitive learning
     - Optimized hyperparameters: max_depth=15, min_samples_leaf=4
     - SMOTE for class imbalance
   - Classical models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost)
   - Deep learning (optional)

5. **Evaluation** üìù
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC
   - Cross-validation and test split

6. **Conclusion & Insights** üìù

|--------------------|--------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest      | 0.8145 | 0.7900   | 0.4971    | 0.6091 | 0.5474   |
| Logistic Regression| -      | -        | -         | -      | -        |

### Top 10 Important Features from Random Forest:
1. Age (0.0527)
2. Anchor age (0.0506)
3. Previous diagnosis count (0.0444)
4. Respiratory rate (mean) (0.0363)
5. ICU duration hours (0.0354)
6. ICU duration hours (log) (0.0341)
7. Shock index (0.0333)
8. Systolic blood pressure (min) (0.0310)
9. SpO2 (mean) (0.0265)
10. Temperature (mean) (0.0262)

### Key Findings:
- Demographic factors (age) are strongly predictive of mortality
- Respiratory parameters emerge as critical predictors
- The derived feature "shock index" demonstrates significant predictive value
- Feature engineering (log transformations, clinical indicators) improved model performance
- Model achieves good discrimination with AUC of 0.8145

_Model evaluation based on 5-fold cross-validation and testing on 20% held-out data._
_Results are preliminary and subject to tuning._
